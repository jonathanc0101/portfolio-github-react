                <p>Sometimes stuff keeps us up at night, sometimes it's work, sometimes it's just our mind not letting the body sleep because it wanders off into a place between the unconscious and a plethora of past experiences.</p>
                <p>Sometimes my mind wanders off to these places, and the only way I have found to keep it down for a while is writing it down.</p>

                    War supposes that there is atleast one conflict between two groups of people, 
                    a conflict big enough that it's justified to make the other group submit to someone's will and even kill if necessary. Just to make a transfer of power, or to maybe change the course of history.

                    <h3>Rules</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is no game without rules, <em>Jus in bello</em> or also called right in war defines which people can be killed and the amount of force allowed. For example: You can't kill a medic or a civilian, you can't use mustard gas or nerve agent, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are rules that apply to everyone involved, but the people on the battlefield are not the players, they are merely tools. The big players are probably safe at home. This is not imperial rome anymore, politicians are not at the front, and the tools are not being used to build a brighter future.

                                If you're at war maybe the difference between the people of the other group and you is merely that, by chance, they were born on the wrong side of the imaginary line that divides two countries. Maybe they think different and it's an ideology problem, maybe they believe in something different and it's a religion problem, maybe they don't believe in anything and just want to watch the world burn because it was unjust to them.

                                Whathever the personal reason, they came to this world alone, and will leave alone, just like you, they and you are merely instruments of someone else that is pulling the strings for some reason.

                <h3>Meaning</h3>
                
                <p>Power can mean a lot of things and throughout history has changed it's meaning, from</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        Manpower: The amount of troops loyal to someone.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        Political influence: The power to pass laws or convince politicians to make decisions.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        International power: The power of a nation to influence others.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        Economic power: The power of an entity to influence the economy.

                </ul>
            
            <h3>Media</h3>
            
                <p>But there is another power that we normally don't take into account, it's the power that mass media have on us, on our way of thinking.</p>
                <p>Evidence for this is the huge role that media outlets play on political elections, the effect of Twitter on the stock market, etc.</p>
                <p>This power has not come alone by itself, we have succumbed to it, we have let ourselves be the product, giving cellphones to our kids since an early age, installing home banking apps to let anyone with our smartphone get access to our bank acount, shopping online what the site recommends us, watching what the algorithm feeds us, we have become sheep once again.</p>

                <h3>Reality</h3>
                <p>I didn't really believe in it, but it doesn't matter if you believe or not, it's not like religion or fairies, it's out there waiting for you to find it, or more precisely, it's inside you, in the form of chemicals that your body releases to make you feel a certain way depending on external and/or internal stimuli.</p>
                <p>Did you think that I was going to say something cheesier than what I already wrote at the half of that paragraph? Cause then you're out of luck, this is a scentific article(mostly) and we are going to talk about what is love not from a humanistic point of view but from a cold mechanical scientific approach.</p>
                
                <h3>Just like hunger</h3>
                <p>
                    Just like hunger, sleep or thirst, it's a mammalian drive, we need it, or at least we feel like we do because biology made us feel that.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Three stages</h3>
                <p>A point of view in which we can stand on is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Fisher_(anthropologist)">Helen Fischer's, she's  an anthropologist and human behavior researcher.</a> She divides it in three overlapping stages</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>   
                        <h4>Lust</h4>
                        <p>This determines who are we attracted to, it helps us identify potential mates. Also known as <em>borogodó</em>.</p>

                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h4>Attraction</h4>
                        <p>
                            Early stage of intense romantic love.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h4>Attachment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Deep feelings of union with a long term partner.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>"Love can start with any of these three feelings, Fisher maintains. Some people have sex with someone new and then fall in love. Some fall in love first, then have sex. Some feel a deep feeling of attachment to another, which then turns into romance and the sex drive. But the sex drive evolved to initiate mating with a range of partners; romantic love evolved to focus one's mating energy on one partner at a time; and attachment evolved to enable us to form a pair bond and rear young together as a team."

            <div class="text-container">
                <p>
                    
                    We all have a notion of what a language is, if you need to tell someone something you're using a language, we probably know that javascript is a language, English is a language, but they're very different. You can go to the shop and use one of this languages to buy a few apples, while, on the other hand, you can use the other one to make a webpage. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Type of language</h3>
                <p>What sets them appart is the type of language, broadly speaking there are two relevant types of language that we will discuss in here</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural languages</li>
                    <li>Formal languages</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <p>
                    In both of these languages there are rules, called grammar, and structure, also called syntax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every language has the basic notion these two things
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Grammar</h4>
                        <p>
                            This defines how you form "words" in english, instructions in ASSEMBLER, etc.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h4>Syntax</h4>
                        <p>This defines how you form sentences, it's not the same to say "hello sir I want to pet your little dog called sausage" instead of "hello dog I want to pet your little sir, sausage called", I added a comma there but you probably get how this works.</p>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Programming and formal languages</h3>
                <p>
                    So, having said this we can continue with the big topic, programming and formal languages.</p>
                    <p>
                        In formal languages whatever you say has only one interpretation, no ambiguity on the effect of the symbols and words you say. There is no equivalent to "I like you" in a formal language, because "I like you" can be interpreted in a few different ways depending on the context.</p>
                        
                
                <p>
                    This is useful because if we want something done exactly as we say but we don't want to do it ourselves we need a system to communicate exactly what we want done.
                    (you might think that everyone who uses a computer is treating it as a slave, and you're probably right)
                </p>
                <p>
                    So ok, we will use a formal language made up to communicate with a computer, also called a programming language, but there is a problem, we can't ask a computer directly with English or any other language that we know, but don't worry, that's already been gradually solved by some really clever people since computers are invented so you can go and write some easy to read Python code and your computer will run it and do what it says. 
                </p>

                <h3>What is this magic?</h3>
                <p>Well, in hell, or also called the 70's and 80's, you would code in assembler, or as close to zeroes and ones as you can get without coding in zeroes and ones. Because that was all that a computer understood. But then some really smart people came up with the idea of a language that you can translate to assembler, but it wasn't as horrible to write, then someone else iterated that process with the higher level language(binary is the lowest, we can only go up), it was like making a tool to make a sharper tool, and bam! 40 years later we probably won't have to code in assembler unless, unless we're making an Operative System or something like that.</p>

                <h3>This process of translation usually goes two ways</h3>
                <ul>
